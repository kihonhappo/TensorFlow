# Overview

DLD Stock Predictor

This project was created to help me learn more about how investing works as well as Machine Learning and the use of Artificial Intelligence and how it can affect our lives. Part of my strategy for creating a stock prediction tool was due to the abundance of documentation and tutorials that have been created on this subject and I thought I would be able to spend more time on the machine learning portion of the project.

The data sets I am accessing for this Application are from Alpha Vantage, a free and premium enterprise-grade global market data service utilizing cloud-based APIs to deliver your data formatted as JSON, XML, Excel, and Google Sheets. Alpha Vantage provides real time and historical financial market data through a set of data APIs and spreadsheets. The asset classes available are stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, foreign exchange rates, and commodities. Alpha Vantage also provides access to additional information such as economic indicators, fundamental data and technical indicators. 

I have always had an interest in investments and financial markets. As I have gained experience as a Full-Stack Developer, I have had a desire to dive into understanding how to leverage my skills to better position my familyâ€™s financial position. I also recognize that I tend to enjoy gambling and have been looking for a way to minimize the emotional part of investing by leveraging aspects of A.I. and machine learning.

# Data Analysis Results

* Investing is like gambling
* There are many more factors such as geo-politics 
* When there is a long enough timespan and a stock is based on a consumer need then that stock has a higher probability of increasing in value inspite of the geo-politics.

* VS Code, Live Server
* Notepad++
* MS Edge, Chrome

# Languages

* Javascript
* Vue 3 Framework

# Future Work

* Fix the preditions function problem. The predictions, 30% data set, seems to be off but the training 70% data set looks to be correct.
* Add Commodities, Exchange Rates, Digital Exchange
* Create model modifiers like geo-politics and economic indicators  
* Add an investor risk aversion assessment tool - this could help minimize the investor "buyers Remorse"
* Add a real estate U.I. and investment models - pull historical data from states and local governments
